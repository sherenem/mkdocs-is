As an enterprise's applications, services, and API adoptions grow, managing identities (such as employees, vendors, partners, and customers) across internal, shared, and SaaS services becomes a significant challenge. The WSO2 Identity Server (WSO2 IS) is a product that can meet this challenge and also provide options to solve identity problems you may encounter in future. 

WSO2 IS is fully open source and is 
released under [<font color="#1565C0">Apache Software License Version 2.0</font>](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), one of the most business-friendly licenses available today. 



## __<font color="#455A64">Common Use Cases</font>__
Identity and access management (IAM) directly influences the security and productivity of an organization and enforces consistency in security policies across the organization. IAMs are particularly advantageous when complying with rules and regulations enforced in some critical domains by governments. This can also be a means to provide access to resources to outside parties without compromising security. A system that uses a proper IAM solution is easier to audit. 

An IAM system would typically have the following.

* User stores and directories
* Authentication of users
* Authorization of users
* Single sign-on
* Provisioning
* Access delegation
* Password reset
* Self-registration
* dAccount locking
